This utility allows you to assign any application installed on your system to open
various filetypes via Total Commander. As a result, whenever you hit F4 in 
Total Commander your file will be opened in the application you selected earlier
and which you consider to be the most appropriate for viewing or editing that filetype.

Install application:
  - open Total Commander
  - unpack this archive to some folder
  - run OpenFileTC.exe. Application will register itself as an editor for Total Commander.
  - restart Total Commander.
  - enjoy!

Work with Open File shell for TC:
  - run Total Commander
  - press F4 on file(s) which you need to edit
  - select item "Another program" and find needed editor. Application will remember your 
    choice and next time open this editor without Open File TC window.

Application is freeware.

         editor will get its files list to edit from both panels - active and not active.
  Added. If you add manually "SendOnlyThisFilesCount=N" parameter for some editor (N is 
         a number more than zero), then this editor will edit files with supported extensions
	 only if you select N files in Total Commander.

  Added. If you add manually "OpenAtOnceForAnyExt=1" parameter to OpenFileTC.ini for some

         operations count is now twice less than it was before.
  Fixed. Common command line for all editor's extensions is now works correctly

         (like Japanese or Chinese symbols) - OFTC doesn't opens them, but starts in
	 Setup mode
  Fixed. Trouble with F4 on exe-files: if user press F4 twice on the same EXE, then 
         OFTC always asks to add this EXE to the editors list. Now OFTC don't ask if 
	 this editor is already in the list.
  Fixed. Trouble with Edit Extensions window resizing is removed

         the virtual drive of FTPDrive, then file size is shown as zero (becomes zero),
	 and editors couldn't find this file to edit. Notice: file size don't changed
